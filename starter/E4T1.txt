# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

1. Restrict SSH access to EC2 instances, disallowing connections from the public internet.
2. Prohibit SSH login for the root account.
3. Implement password configurations requiring complexity, including a minimum of 8 characters, the use of specific character types, and prevention of password reuse.

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

- Employ the principle of least privilege for the current instance role profile, granting access solely to designated buckets instead of utilizing a wildcard (*). Additionally, consider implementing a bucket policy for further control.
- Enhance the security of the S3 bucket contents with the following measures:
  > Activate server-side encryption for the S3 bucket.
  > Limit the instance profile role to read-only access from S3 until the application necessitates write permissions.
