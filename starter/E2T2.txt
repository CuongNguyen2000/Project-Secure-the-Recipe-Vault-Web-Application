Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

1. The IAM policy grants overly broad access to resources, deviating from the principle of least privilege by providing full access.
2. The load balancer lacks configuration for redirecting non-SSL (HTTP) requests to SSL (HTTPS).
3. The application running on port 5000 is exposed and easily accessible directly from the public internet.
4. S3 buckets lack server-side encryption and logging is not enabled.
5. The IAM password policy is non-compliant regarding the minimum length for the Root account.
6. AWS Systems Manager should be utilized for the management of the EC2 instance.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

# Configure IAM policy for read-only access.
# Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for root access.
# Enforce a more stringent IAM password policy.
# Restrict traffic on the Load Balancer to enhance security.
# Deactivate unnecessary port access to the EC2 instance.
# Enable logging for S3 buckets to enhance audit capabilities.
# Allow traffic only from specified security groups for improved access control.
